            The designer of C# is "Anders Hejlsberg" — we’ve stored his name in a variable called designer. Call Console.WriteLine() using designer as an argument.

            Now, let’s print only Anders’ second name.

            First, find the index of the space(" ") in the string designer and store it in a variable indexOfSpace.

            You’ll need to use the IndexOf() method.

            The space character itself is not part of the second name.

            Create a new integer indexOfSecondName and instanciate it with a value of indexOfSpace plus 1.

            Use Substring() and the variable indexOfSecondName to get the second name.

            Store the returned value in a variable secondName.You can view the documentation if you’re not sure how to use this method.
