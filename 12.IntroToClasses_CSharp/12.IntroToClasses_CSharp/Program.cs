                Reference the image for some conceptual examples of custom classes.Note that each class is associated with 2 variables and 1 method.The variables represent the state, such as whether or not the lightbulb is on and how many watts it consumes.The methods represent behaviors, such as turning the lightbulb on.

                NOTE: Testing this kind of code takes longer, so some checkpoints in this lesson will need more time to run.It’s worth the wait!

            1.
            We will define our class in Forest.cs and work with that class in the Main() method in Program.cs.

            Within the namespace DefiningClasses, build an empty Forest class in Forest.cs.

            Checkpoint 2 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed
            2.
            In Main() within Program.cs, make a new instance of the Forest class and store the result in variable f.

            Forest f = new Forest();
