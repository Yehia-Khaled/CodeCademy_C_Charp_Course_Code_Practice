                Reference the image for some conceptual examples of custom classes.Note that each class is associated with 2 variables and 1 method.The variables represent the state, such as whether or not the lightbulb is on and how many watts it consumes.The methods represent behaviors, such as turning the lightbulb on.

                NOTE: Testing this kind of code takes longer, so some checkpoints in this lesson will need more time to run.It’s worth the wait!
